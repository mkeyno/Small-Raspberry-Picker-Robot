# Small-Raspberry-Picker-Robot
This project intend to make small and affordable robot, fitted in ordinary Raspberry farm lane size (less than 40 cm)  to pick fresh fruit.

Each arm utilized identical camera (image processing), TOF precise distance sensor(localize the target), doted laser beam (reference point)and processing board (raspberry pi 3b)
Ultra sonique (radar scanner)is utilized for robot forward/backward movement and DC motor driver for control the DC motors
robot arm , gripper and sensor coordination controlled by servos, and each arm and DC motor has its dedicated battery (max 8)
