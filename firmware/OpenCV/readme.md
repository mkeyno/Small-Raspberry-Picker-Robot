#Fruit Detection #


   The simplest code to catch the ripe red  berry fruit video frame in OpenCV and turn it to HSV format.then grab the upper and lower      bounds of the color we would like to detect. In this case, we choose the values from yellow/red-ish to completely red.
   We create a numpy array containing these and create mask to catch perfect color, but this simple approach prone to undesirable          result, that's my many object detection  followed by **deep learning** module in OpenCV
  ***(dnn)***  is the OpenCVâ€™s module to load a pre-trained object detection network. there are many method & framework for object         detection using deep learning with different aspects of difficulty , implementation , speed and size
  on platform such raspberry-pi 3b+ Network architectures such as  ***MobileNets*** along with SSD(Single Shot Detectors) framework is     between our constraints and goals
